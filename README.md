# odin-recipes



The main aim of this project was to put to test the current HTML knowledge that I have currently acquired thus far.
I built a basic recipe website.

## Lessons Learnt 

1. The largest lesson takeway was the use of ordered list and unordered list.
2. The git basics were also quite useful. Understanding how to use my terminal from the vscode output section and file struture were key components of this task.
3. I also tried to adhere to clean code structure. 
4. I could have done better in placing the images inside a seperate folder
5. I will also try and title the documents when styling begins.
